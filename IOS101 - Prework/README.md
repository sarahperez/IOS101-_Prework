## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite applications
- 1: Spotify
    - Personalized suggestions
    - Playlist organization
- 2: BeReal
    - Saves history of old BeReals
    - Takes pictures with both front and backfacing cameras
- 3: Mint
    - Tracks all spending and categorizes transactions
    - Tracks all accounts and provides weekly summaries

### An app I would like to build

I want to build an imporoved version of Mint aimed towards college students. I use Mint, however, I often find that a lot of the functions are not within my needs and thus, clutter the app for me. I would change the aethetics of the application to appeal to younger adults encouraging them to be financially concious and smart. Additionally, I would add features that would help a college student pay for college expenses such as tuition. 

## Notes

I did not encounter many issues however, the ones that I did encounter were due to my unfamiliarity with macOS as I am a new macOS user who has recently switched from using WindowsOS for many years.
